# NextAuth Email Provider Fix Summary

## Issue
The NextAuth Email Provider was configured but throwing an `EMAIL_REQUIRES_ADAPTER_ERROR` because it requires a database adapter to store verification tokens.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Prisma Adapter**
   - Installed `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` package
   - Configured Prisma adapter in `auth.ts`

2. **Updated Prisma Schema**
   - Added necessary NextAuth models to Prisma schema:
     - Account
     - Session
     - VerificationToken
   - Updated User model with NextAuth-specific fields
   - Generated migrations to apply these changes

3. **Added Email Provider Configuration**
   - Used existing Gmail SMTP configuration from `.env.local`
   - Added EmailProvider to auth options in `auth.ts`

4. **Created Verification Request Page**
   - Added `/auth/verify-request/page.tsx` for handling email verification links
   - Styled the verification page to match the application's design

5. **Enhanced Login Page**
   - Added option to sign in with email link
   - Implemented UI toggle between password and email login
   - Added success state after sending an email link

## How It Works

1. When a user chooses "Sign in with email link", they only need to enter their email address.
2. NextAuth sends a verification link to the user's email.
3. When the user clicks the link, they are authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
4. If the user doesn't receive the email, they can return to the login page and try again.

## Verification Tokens

The verification tokens are now stored in the database, allowing for secure passwordless authentication. The tokens are generated with an expiration time and are one-time use only.

## Testing

To test the email sign-in:
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Click "Sign in with email link instead"
4. Enter an email address and click "Send sign-in link"
5. Check your email for the verification link
6. Click the link to be automatically signed in

Note: The email provider is using the Gmail SMTP server configured in `.env.local`. Make sure the credentials are valid.
